			<p><span class="h">I Spy Graphics</span><br>
			This print was created by London-based
			designer Mark Blamire at Blam for an art
			exhibit called "I Spy Graphics." The brief
			for all the designers who took part was
			to respond visually to the phrase. “I Spy
			With My Little Eye" with something that
			had inspied them in the preceding 24
			hours. The overall aim of “I spy” was
			to profile graphic design as a valuable
			art form and to offer designers an
			opportunity to use their creative skills
			outside the commercial domain.</p>
			<p>Inspired by letters on his son's bedroom
			door. Blamire created a poster that
			contains no vowels. "My son Jack has his
			name on his bedroom door in wooden
			letters, and he pulled the letter ‘A' off, but
			I liked the way it still said his name, ‘JCK.’”
			he explains. “When thought about it, it
			tickled me that you have the ability" to say
			‘FCKFF o someone—sorry. I do like
			swearing – without the use of VWLS."</p>
			<p>Set in Helvetica Neue 75 Bold, the poster
			Is, in short, a diagram illustrating how the
			English soccer league tables were at the
			end of the 2005—2006 season. The poster
			also formed part of an exhibit curated
			by online gallery Blanka as part of the
			London Design Festival 2006. Titled
			“1-An Exhibition in Mono," it featured
			the work of 28 designers who have all
			produced A1-sized (23% x 331/8 in/594 x
			841 mm) black-and-white posters.</p>
